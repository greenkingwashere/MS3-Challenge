This application is for a coding challenge for MS3. 
All of the test data files you will use should be place in the **data** directory. The supplied test file is also in this directory. 

The program is organized into three files. The main file *MS3ChallengeApplication* runs the main program. The file *Database.java* is the class for creating a database object for communicating with the sqlite database. The final file is a static class *CSVLoader.java* which handles the reading of the CSV files. 

To run the program make sure to have the sqlite-jdbc supplied in the classpath. The github for this module is at https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc.
